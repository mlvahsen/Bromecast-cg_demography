# Bromecast Common Garden Demography manuscript
Code for Vahsen et al. manuscript on Bromecast common garden data analysis of survival, fecundity, and fitness.

The script code/main_script.R is the main script needed to run the analyses. All figures can be generated from separate scripts in code/ once the analysis script has been run.

All code was run in R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31). Necessary packages to run scripts are identified at the top of each script.

All R scripts are written assuming the below organizational structure:

```

└─── code
└─── data
└─── figs
└─── outputs
└─── supp_code
